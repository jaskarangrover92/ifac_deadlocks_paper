This repository contains MATLAB files to reproduce results from our paper *Why Does Symmetry Cause Deadlocks? There are two folders, one for analysis and simulation results for two-robot deadlock, and another for results on three-robot deadlock. Analysis results refer to symbolic proofs of the lemmas and theorems in the paper.
